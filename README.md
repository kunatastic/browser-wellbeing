## Technical Details

### Data Schema

The extension stores session data in the following format:

```javascript
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/user/repo",
      "start_time": 1696521600000,  // timestamp in milliseconds
      "end_time": 1696525200000,
      "favicon": "https://github.com/favicon.ico"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tracking Events

The extension tracks:

- **Tab switches**: When you move between different tabs
- **URL changes**: When you navigate within a tab
- **Window focus**: When you switch between browser and other applications
- **Browser startup**: When you open Chrome

### Domain Extraction

- Removes `www.` prefix (e.g., `www.github.com` â†’ `github.com`)
- Groups all pages from the same domain together
- Skips Chrome internal pages (`chrome://`, `chrome-extension://`)

## Debugging

### Console Logs

The extension includes comprehensive logging for debugging:

1. **Open Developer Tools**:

   - Right-click the extension icon â†’ "Inspect popup"
   - Or go to `chrome://extensions/` â†’ Click "Inspect views: background page"

2. **Look for these log messages**:
   - `ðŸŽ¯ Background script loaded` - Extension started
   - `ðŸš€ Started new session` - Tracking began
   - `ðŸ”š Ending session` - Session completed
   - `ðŸ“Š Storage check` - Periodic data verification

### Common Issues
